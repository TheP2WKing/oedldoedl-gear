# Changelog

## [4.0.0] - 2024-03-03

### 1.12.2 isn't dead, it just took some time

Also check out the other mods that have been updated or released! This is a complete rewrite of the old 2.x version and many things have changed since then. The most significant change is that almost everything that was seen in v3.x for 1.16.5 is more or less included in the release, with lots of extras on top.
